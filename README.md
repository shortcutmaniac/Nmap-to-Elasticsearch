# Nmap-to-Elasticsearch
During my Time creating an Attack Surface Mangement for Bug Hunting I came across that saving data in Elastic is a pretty nice thing. So i wrote a simple Importer that parses the Hostname, IP, Service Name and Port into JSON and imports it into Elastic. Also you can add a subsidiary in order to map your Attack-Surface to the Companies you are scanning. This code does check if a hostname already exists, if yes it only updates the values. If the Hostname does not exist, then it will add it.
